<p>The above position is for a software developer for a trading company based in Sydney. The main appeal for me was that the job is for long term software development, they specify that the developer would be creating multiple components and applications. Rather than working on one large solution, I would prefer to create multiple since I can find that working on a very large program to be sluggish at times, since coding can never always be fun.
The job asks for Strong C++ skills and C# experience as a requirement for creating what the employee has asked for. They also ask for scripting skills in python and testing, debugging and other quality assurance in development. The employer also expresses a greater interest in potential workers with bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or related field. They also list other requirements, which mainly revolve around work environments.
Currently, I only have experience coding in Python, C#, Java, JavaScript and Basic. However, I would not be considered as being particularly strong in any of those languages. In terms of experience in coding for an employer, the most I have done is a few assignments in VCE, creating a program for a 'client'.
Since I currently do not know any C++, I would have to rigorously learn, through whatever resources available to me and gaining actual experience so I can have enough skill to fulfill the requirement. Having experience and basic understand in both Python and C# allows me to be able to build off what I currently have, however since the employee did not specify the level of 'experience' desired, it would be best to improve on this as I gain experience for other requirements. Since the employer wants someone with robust experience, I would not be able to take this right away, even if I had the skills necessary. To get the qualifications, I would take up other jobs that give me a good enough opportunity to hone the skills I need and gain experience (mainly working in teams and environments that work with trading).</p>
