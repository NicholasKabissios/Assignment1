         <h1>Welcome to my Assignment1 Submission!</h1>


<div class="main-text">
         <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Kabissios (just call me Nick or Niko), I turned 19 years old this year, my student number is s3840379 and my email is s3840379@student.rmit.edu.au
Currently living in Melbourne and studying for my first year in RMIT, coming right from VCE.
         </p>

         <p>My background is fully Greek, and I grew up around my family and semi-fluently speak the language.
         I have an obsession/ love for music but besides that I spend my time playing video games, reading, and enjoying the outdoors.</p>

         <p>I have been practicing karate since a young age and from the start of high school until recently I have been competing in tournaments and will continue to do so as it is one of the passions I have found in my life.
