<p>For me, the results of these test just affirm inner thoughts about myself and the self-knowledge I already had. The tests do give another angle on how to describe and articulate the potential issues or flaws I can find in myself. I could potentially use these tests to evaluate things I would like to change about myself, but I would prefer to work on myself without outside input.
In a team setting I do not think that these results would change much. Currently I don't have much experience working in a team, however when I do get more experience I could potentially see if I can refer to the results and see how I can improve for the sake of chemistry within the team and preventing any problems/ conflict.
The results would be able to give a rough indicator on how each member would interact with each other, but should only be used as such since there are many other factors that should be considered in addition to personality when forming a team.</p>
